# AI Rockfall Prediction System

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered rockfall risk prediction system designed to help mining and geological safety teams assess rockfall hazards. It uses machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM) trained on geological and environmental data to compute risk probability.

## Features
- Interactive Streamlit web app UI
- Input 11 key geological and environmental parameters
- Choose between three ML models with accuracy display
- Real-time rockfall risk prediction with color-coded gauge
- Animated alert banners for high-risk scenarios
- Feature importance visualization for interpretation
- Tutorial and about section for user guidance

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

2. Install required packages:

3. Run the Streamlit app:


## Usage
- Open the app in the browser.
- Select your preferred model from the sidebar.
- Input the geological and environmental feature values.
- View the risk probability gauge and alerts.
- Explore the feature importance tab for model insights.
